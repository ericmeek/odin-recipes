    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dirty rice is an old Louisiana favorite. It's name comes from the way in which it was cooked. It's traditionally been a dish of rice, Louisiana spices, and whatever meat poor folk usually had on hand. It's called "dirty" because it does not look like traditional white rice.</p>
